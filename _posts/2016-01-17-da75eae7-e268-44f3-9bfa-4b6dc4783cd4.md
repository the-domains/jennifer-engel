Jennifer Engel's mission in life is help people

unlock their unlimited potential through her writings 

and motivational speaking. 

She is currently working on a writing about  her experience as a 

breast-cancer survivor and the reflection process that occurred 

as a result in her memoire, "_Heaven Under Construction," _which will be officially published summer of 2016\. Along with the lessons she shares in her nonfiction cancer survivor's journey, she is also working on a slip-fiction children's book, or young adult novel, entitled_"Momma Bloom of the Dark Waters." _

Jennifer has been a member of the Schaumburg Scribes Writer's Group since fall of 2014 where she has since taken on the role of secretary.

While she may seem new to the writing world, she has been teaching reading and literature in the public school setting for the past twenty years.

She now feels it is time to gather everything she has learned from reading other people's work into creating her own unique and  powerfully impactful poetic-prose style, which she hopes will inspire others to find and unlock their own unlimited illuminating power.
